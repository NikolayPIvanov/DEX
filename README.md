# DEX
A decentralized exchange with pure Web3 functionality.
The goal of the Dex is to allow users to swap coins and tokens without the need for a KYC processed enforced by the custodial platforms.

The MVP version will have limited support for a few pairs.

An order book will be included.

## Hardhat
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
